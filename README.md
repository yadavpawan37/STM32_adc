This project demonstrates how to use the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) on an STM32 microcontroller to measure an analog input voltage. The measured voltage is displayed and used to control various outputs (e.g., LEDs). The project is set up to read ADC values either periodically or on-demand using an external trigger.

Requirements
Hardware: STM32 Development Board (e.g., STM32 Nucleo, STM32 Discovery)
Software:
STM32CubeMX for code generation and configuration
STM32CubeIDE or other supported IDEs like Keil or IAR for compilation
Serial monitor (optional) to display ADC readings
Features
ADC Readings: Continuously reads analog input on a specified ADC channel.
LED Control: Uses ADC readings to control LEDs based on voltage thresholds.
Sleep Mode (optional): Saves power when ADC measurements are not needed.
DMA Support: Configurable to use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to transfer ADC data efficiently without CPU intervention.
Configuration
ADC Configuration:

Resolution: 12-bit (configurable)
Channel: Select the ADC channel (e.g., PA0 for ADC_IN0).
Sampling Time: Set to an appropriate value depending on the input signal.
Continuous Conversion: Enable if continuous reading is desired, or set to trigger mode for single readings.
DMA Setup (optional):

Enable DMA for ADC to allow efficient data transfer.
Configure DMA with the correct settings for memory and peripheral addresses.
Voltage Reference:

Make sure the ADC voltage reference (V_REF) is set correctly in STM32CubeMX.
Typical value: 3.3V.
Clock Settings:

Ensure the ADC clock is set within the correct range for the selected resolution.
Getting Started
Generate Initialization Code with STM32CubeMX:

Configure the ADC, GPIOs, and (optionally) DMA in STM32CubeMX.
Generate and export the project files to your IDE.
Code Implementation:

ADC Start: Start the ADC in continuous or single-conversion mode.
Read ADC Value: Use HAL_ADC_PollForConversion or HAL_ADC_GetValue to read the converted value.
Voltage Calculation:
Convert the ADC reading to a voltage using the formula:
Voltage
=
​Convert the ADC reading to a voltage using the formula:
Voltage=(ADC Value/ 2^resolution  −1 )×VREF
​

Compile and Flash:

Build the project in your IDE.
Flash the code to the STM32 board using the appropriate tool (e.g., ST-Link).
Test the ADC:

Connect an analog signal (e.g., a potentiometer) to the configured ADC input pin.
Monitor the voltage and ADC values through a serial monitor or an LED indicator if configured.
